## QA Engineering Problem
Hello and thanks for taking part in our QA engineering interview process! To help us better understand your approach to automated testing we've created an example site for you to verify behavior. We hope that you find this project interesting and fun. This is a fabricated use case, but one that presents an opportunity to show off your capabilities as a technical QA.
